# JEAR
It's not an acronym it's just Loud.

While I work on [yelling][yelling], the *other* static site generator for my website [nyble.dev][nyble-dev], I want a frictionless way to put things on my website. I could write a lot of HTML and stuff, but for some reason this seemed easier *(and I'm still writing HTML and stuff I just mean- well I don't know what I mean)*. Anyway that's what JEAR is. It's a little file builder thing. It's temporary and it's bad. Don't use it! It's only here so I get another "Used by" count on [bempline][bempline] *(it's a joke.. i think)*.

A few things use a Markdown dialect that I've been making *(because of course; we all need our own kind-of-markdown markup language,,,)*. It's called [quark][quark].
